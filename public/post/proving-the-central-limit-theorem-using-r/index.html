<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Much of what we do in statistics lies on assumptions of normal distributions.</p>
<p>We’ll begin by defining the number of repeitions (r) and draws per repitition (c), and writing a function to take the row averages of a matrix</p>
<pre class="r"><code>r &lt;- 10
n &lt;- 50

sample.means &lt;- function(samps, r, n) {
  rowMeans(matrix(samps, nrow = r, ncol = n))
}</code></pre>
<p>Next we simulate random draws from the distribution described by Mastering Metrics, and call our function on these draws</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(100)
samps &lt;- rbinom(r*n, size = 1, prob = .8)
samp.means &lt;- sample.means(samps, r, n)</code></pre>
<p>All we have to do now is plot the results and voila:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(plotly)

sample &lt;- qplot(samps, geom = &quot;histogram&quot;, bins = 30, main = &quot;Sample Histogram&quot;)
sample_means &lt;- qplot(samp.means, geom = &quot;histogram&quot;, bins = 30, main = &quot;Sample Mean Histogram&quot;)

p1 &lt;- ggplotly(sample)
p2 &lt;- ggplotly(sample_means)

subplot(p1, p2)</code></pre>
