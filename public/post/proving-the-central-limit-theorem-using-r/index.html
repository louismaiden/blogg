<h1>Proving the Central Limit Theorem using R</h1>
<p><em>Mastering Metrics</em> by Joshua D. Angrist &amp; John-Steffen Pischke provides a wonderful explanation of the Central Limit Theorem illustrated by a dummy variable indicating sick vs healthy individuals, the latter who account for 80% of a population:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The distribution of this dummy variable has two spikes, one of height .8 at the value 1 and one of height .2 at the value 0. The CLT tells us that with enough data, the distribution of the t-statistic is smooth and bell-shaped even though the distribution of the underlying data has only two values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those interested in statistical inference, the Central Limit Theorem is one of the most important concepts to understand beyond mere recognition. Here I’ll explain it in basic language and provide a simple way of simulating it using R.</p>
<p>We’ll begin by defining the number of repeitions, <code>r</code>, and draws per repitition, <code>n</code>, and writing a function to take the row averages of a matrix</p>
<pre class="r"><code>r &lt;- 150
n &lt;- 50

sample.means &lt;- function(samps, r, n) {
  rowMeans(matrix(samps, nrow = r, ncol = n))
}</code></pre>
<p>Next we simulate random draws from the distribution described by Mastering Metrics, and call our function on these draws</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1000)
samps &lt;- rbinom(r*n, size = 1, prob = .8)
samp.means &lt;- sample.means(samps, r, n)</code></pre>
<p>All we have to do now is plot the results and voila:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(plotly)

sample &lt;- qplot(samps, geom = &quot;histogram&quot;, bins = 30, main = &quot;&quot;)
sample_means &lt;- qplot(samp.means, geom = &quot;histogram&quot;, bins = 30, main = &quot;&quot;)

p1 &lt;- ggplotly(sample)
p2 &lt;- ggplotly(sample_means)

subplot(p1, p2)</code></pre>
