      <description>Proving the Central Limit Theorem using RI came across a For those interested in statistical inference, the Central Limit Theorem is one of the most important concepts to understand beyond mere recognition. Here I’ll explain it in basic language and provide a simple way of simulating it using R.
We’ll begin by defining the number of repeitions (r) and draws per repitition (c), and writing a function to take the row averages of a matrix</description>

      <description>Hey All -
I have a few new ideas for little data projects and will be posting here from now on. Eventually this will be louismaiden.com.

      <description>This website is a personal homepage.
The site is built with Hugo—a static site generator made with Go. The website source code is available on GitHub. It uses the cocoa theme. The posts are written in Markdown.
The primary font face is Open Sans and the monospace font face is Ubuntu Mono. The social icons are from the Ionicons font set. CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using Pygments.</description>
