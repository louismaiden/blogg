      <description>Chart-topping songs are getting more depressing over timeFeeling down lately? It could be the music you’re listening to.

      <description>What is the central limit theorem?Perhaps the most important concept in statistical inference. It gives us two primary insights:
If a variable is normally distributed, the sampling distribution of a test statistic calculated from this variable will also be normally distributed.
If a variable’s distribution is non-normal or unknown, the sampling distribution of its test statistics approach normality as sample size increases.</description>

      <description>Hey All -
I have a few new ideas for little data projects and will be posting here from now on. Eventually this will be louismaiden.com.

      <description>This website is a personal homepage.
The site is built with Hugo—a static site generator made with Go. The website source code is available on GitHub. It uses the cocoa theme. The posts are written in Markdown.
The primary font face is Open Sans and the monospace font face is Ubuntu Mono. The social icons are from the Ionicons font set. CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using Pygments.</description>
