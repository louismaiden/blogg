<h1>Simulating the Central Limit Theorem using R</h1>
<div id="what-is-the-central-limit-theorem" class="section level2">
<h2>What is the central limit theorem?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important concept in statistical inference. It gives us two primary insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If a variable is normally distributed, the sampling distribution of a test statistic calculated from this variable will also be normally distributed.</p></li>
<li><p>If a variable’s distribution is non-normal or unknown, the sampling distribution of its test statistics approach normality as sample size increases.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="why-is-it-important" class="section level2">
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Normality assumptions arise frequently in statistics and econometrics: hypothesis testing relies on a normaly distributed sampling distribution to allow us to know the likelihood of a particular test statistic occuring (i.e. the basis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance">statistical significance</a>). General linear models require normally distributed residuals. The list goes on.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is to replicate the process of drawing repeated samples from a population with underlying non-normal distribution of our choosing, as a simplified version of this great <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40307510/central-limit-theorem-in-r">stack overflow response</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll take <code>t</code> trials of size <code>n</code> and store them in a matrix, then calculate the mean of each trial in a function as such:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sample.means &lt;- function(samps, t, n) {
  rowMeans(matrix(samps, nrow = t, ncol = n))
}</code></pre>
<p>Our underlying distribution will take on values of one 80% of the time and zero 20% of the time - quite far from normality.</p>
<p>After using <code>set.seed()</code> to ensure reproducibility, we define <code>t</code> and <code>n</code> with some “low” values. The rbinom function will return random draws of 1 according to our defined probabililty, which we store in <code>samps</code>. Finally, we use our samp.means function above to calculate the average of each trial, giving us a total of <code>t</code> sample means.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1000)

t &lt;- 150
n &lt;- 50

samps &lt;- rbinom(t*n, size = 1, prob = .8)
samp.means &lt;- sample.means(samps, t, n)</code></pre>
<p>All we have to do now is plot histograms of the underlying data <code>samps</code> and the sample means <code>samp.means</code>, and voila: </p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(plotly)

sample &lt;- qplot(samps, geom = &quot;histogram&quot;, bins = 30, main = &quot;&quot;)
sample_means &lt;- qplot(samp.means, geom = &quot;histogram&quot;, bins = 30, main = &quot;&quot;)

p1 &lt;- ggplotly(sample)
p2 &lt;- ggplotly(sample_means)

subplot(p1, p2)</code></pre>
